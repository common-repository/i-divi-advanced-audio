This simple plugin is based on Divi Theme and/or on Divi Builder plugin. It just adds some design options to the default Divi Audio module.

== Description ==

You just have to activate the plugin and go building your posts, pages or projects; you will find in the Divi Audio module some new design options both under the 'Content' tab ('Audio Timeline Margin' setting under 'Audio' toggle and 'Image Width' under 'Image' toggle) and in the 'Design' one (here you will find at the top a new 'Audio' toggle to customize timeline colors and other).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin add a new Audio module? =
No, it doesn't. The plugin just customize the existing Divi Audio module adding new settings to it.

= Are the added settings compatible with the Divi Visual Builder? =
At the moment the compatibility for the Visual Builder is only partial. You will see the new settings in the VB, you can customize and save them in the VB but you can't see the changes directly in the VB. In order to see the changes you have to preview the post even if you are building your page in VB mode.
